# [NeuRL](https://neu-rl.netlify.app) - A No-Code Web-Based Agent Environment for Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
NeuRL is a free and accessible no-code web-based application that allows innovative real-time exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks. Designed for students and instructors, NeuRL provides interactive 3D WebGL environments, enabling users to experiment with multiple RL algorithms and observe the evolution of agents and neural networks as agents learn to accomplish tasks.

## Features
- **Interactive Learning Modules:** Visualize reinforcement learning algorithms in action.
- **Playground Mode:** Experiment with different settings and observe agent behaviors.
- **No Installation Required:** Accessible via modern web browsers without additional software.
- **GPU-Optimized Processing:** Enables efficient training of multiple agents in real-time without pre-installing deep learning libraries.

## Getting Started
### Accessing NeuRL
NeuRL is available at [neu-rl.netlify.app](https://neu-rl.netlify.app). No installation is required, as it runs directly in the browser.

### Navigation
- **Lesson Mode:** Step-by-step guided learning with structured experiments.
- **Playground Mode:** Open-ended exploration with configurable agent parameters.
- **Settings Panel:** Adjust visualization preferences and environment configurations.

## Using NeuRL
### For Students
1. **Observe Agent Behavior:** Analyze how reinforcement learning agents interact with the environment.
2. **Interpret Graphs:** The system displays key performance metrics, such as predicted value and episode length.
3. **Experiment with Policies:** Modify hyperparameters to explore different training behaviors.
4. **Explore Neural Network Structures:** Gain insights into how different network hyperparameters affect learning efficiency.
